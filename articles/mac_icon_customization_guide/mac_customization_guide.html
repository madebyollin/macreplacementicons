<div id="post_intro"><h2>Mac Icon Customization Guide</h2>
<p>I've been customizing and experimenting with my Mac's icons for almost 5 years now.  Here, I've done my best to provide clear, simple, and complete icon customization instructions so that others can do the same.</p>

<p>This guide focuses on the use of <span class="purple">.icns</span> files.  They're the most common way to distribute Mac icons, and most free icons <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=icns">you find on dribbble</a> [or elsewhere] will be in this format.</p>
</div>



<h3>File &amp; Folder Icons:</h3>
<p>Customizing the icon of an individual file or folder is very easy.</p>


<ol>
    <li>Select the file/folder you want to customize and press <code>Command + I</code> or the <code>File > Get Info</code> menu item to bring up the file/folder's Info window.</li>
    <li>Drag and Drop the <span class="purple">.icns</span> file you want to use onto the 32px thumbnail in the Information panel.</li>
</ol>

<img style="width:800px;height:300px" src="demo_files_folders_2.gif" />
<p>This will assign the <span class="purple">.icns</span> file to the file or folder you're customizing<span class="footnote">technically, inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork#The_Macintosh_file_system">Resource Fork"</a> of that file.</span>.</p>

<p>To remove this custom icon, first click on the 32px thumbnail in the Info window to select the custom icon, then press the "delete" key to remove it and revert to the original.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>Command + C</code> and <code>Command + V</code> on the thumbnails to Copy-and-Paste icons from one file's Info window to another.  For older icon-sets that appear as folders with custom icons applied [rather than as pure <span class="purple">.icns</span> files], thumbnail Copy-and-Paste is <em>the</em> way to use the icons on your own desktop.</p>

<h3>Application Icons:</h3>

<p>The previous Get Info + Drag &amp; Drop method can also be used to replace Application icons.</p>
<img style="width:640px;height:300px;" src="demo_application_icons_0.gif" />
<p>This method isn't perfect, though.  If you use the "Get Info" method, Applications that modify or decorate their Application icon work will revert to the original when decorating the icon.</p>
<img style="width:512px;height:128px;" src="demo_nonmas_icons_1.png" />
<p>Manual replacement doesn't have this problem:</p>
<img style="width:512px;height:128px;" src="demo_nonmas_icons_2.png" />
<p>For Mac App Store apps that are code-signed for security, manual replacement <strong>will probably break the app</strong>.<span class="footnote">Although I've had some luck with manual replacement followed by running the Xcode-reliant command <code>sudo codesign -f -s /Applications/SomeApp.app</code> in Terminal.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your MAS apps, just use the "Get Info" method.  For non-MAS apps, though, manual replacement is a more reliable way to customize the icon.</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the Application you want to customize isn't running.</li>
    <li>Right click on the Application you want to customize in Finder and select <code>Show Package Contents</code>. Then open the folder named "Contents", and, inside, the folder named "Resources". <img style="width:640px;height:120px;border-radius:0px;" src="demo_application_icons_1.png" /></li>
    <li>Find the <span class="purple">.icns</span> file inside the "Resources" folder.  You can sort by size to find it quickly–it will usually be at the top of the list. <img style="width:480px;height:240px;border-radius:0px;" src="demo_application_icons_2.png" /></li>
    <li>Back up this original <span class="purple">.icns</span> file by changing the name/extension somehow.  Adding '.backup' to the end is an easy system. <img style="width:480px;height:240px;border-radius:0px;" src="demo_application_icons_3.png" /></li>
    <li>Copy your replacement icon into the folder, and change the name to match the old <span class="purple">.icns</span> file. Now when the Application searches for its icon file, it'll use the replacement instead of the original.<img style="width:480px;height:240px;border-radius:0px;" src="demo_application_icons_4.png" /></li>
</ol>
<h3>Automated Replacement:</h3>
<p>For Applications that frequently update [like Spotify or Dropbox], manually replacing the icon after each update can be tedious.  Thankfully, this process can be automated using OS X's built-in Automator.  Here's a sample Applet that quits Automator, replaces the Spotify icon, and quits the dock so that the change takes effect immediately:</p>
<img style="width:512px;height:720px;border-radius:0px;" src="automator_icon_replacer.png" />
<p>For most Applications, this is overkill, but for a few it's very helpful.</p>
<h3>System Icons:</h3>

<p>Although manual replacement of System Icons is possible<span class="footnote">You can find most of then in the Resources subdirectory of <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/</code></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;, there are some free, intuitive apps to make this process very easy:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.freemacsoft.net/liteicon/">LiteIcon</a> for OS X 10.9 and up.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond">CandyBar</a> for OS X 10.8 and prior.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these to change the default folder icons, document icons, sidebar icons, Finder/Trash icons, and other System-wide images.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a good system set, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.rad-e8.com/">Minium</a>, or <a href="http://louie.land/icons/">De Anza Folders/Ive Drives</a>.</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Changes to icons may take a bit to propogate through Finder and the Dock.  Relaunching Finder/Dock using Activity Monitor or Terminal can speed up your customization.</p>
<p>These methods should all work on Yosemite as well as the less flat versions of Mac OS X. Please contact me at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/madebyollin">@madebyollin</a> or <a href="mailto:madebyollin@gmail.com">madebyollin@gmail.com</a> if one of them doesn't.</p>
<p>Happy customizing ❤</p>
